Q. How many variation is qzMiniHtml?
A. QzMiniHtml    - very simple implementation of html, used in Tips n Tricks in QuickZip3
   (Delphi.W32)    not released at that time because there was better component at that time.
                   (now included in QzMiniHtml2 package)

   QzMiniHtml2   - This component was intended to design for full Html support for QuickZip40
   (Delphi.W32)    (although it end up used in few dialogs only).
                   Version 2 is a lot more complicated than the last one, 
                    1. New parsing code, html syntax is now parsed, updated and drew. 
                    2. Supported tags - Most standard Html tag supported.
                                        including fontStyles, tables and user defined.
                    3. More controls - including ScrollBox, CheckBox, Marquee.
                    4. Database support - coded by Wilfrid, please check the forum.
                       PDF Output support

   qzMiniHtml.net - QzMiniHtml2 is not portable to dotNet environment (even with VCL.Net),
   (Delphi.Net)     so qzMiniHtml.net is a full rewrite, the major update as below:
                    1. Full dotNet 1.1 support, including Compact Framework
                    2. Casade style sheet support.
                    3. Folder like childTag List, which makes locating a tag faster.
                    4. Reduce amount of tag types (e.g. bold, italic ---> fontStyleTag)
                    5. Downloading from http/ftp
                         
                    This version is now abandoned because it does not working too well,
                    The assembly (.dll) compilied by D.Net include Vcl.Net which make it 
                    large, plus you cannot use 2 assembly compilied by D.Net at a time.
                    The Set syntax is not usable in C# and VB.Net.

                    1. More accurate text width estimation.
                    2. Multiple ways of output. (Graphics only at this time, can support more)
                    3. Multiple ways of input. (Text, Html, BBCode, can support more)
                    4. Reduced amount of tag types and memory usage.
                    5. WYSIWYG editor. (Not completed)

Q. Whats the difference between qzMiniHtml_11.dll and qzMiniHtml_20.dll?
A. qzMiniHtml_11.dll is based on dotNet 1.1, and qzMiniHtml_20.dll is based on dotNet 2.0
   if you using Borland BDS or Turbo line products use qzMiniHtml_11.dll,
   (Turbo Explorer user please read TurboExplorerUser.txt as well)
   SharpDevelop2+ and VS2005+ user can use qzMiniHtml_20.dll.
   qzMiniHtml_20.dll support SmartTags, which makes developement easier.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. What kind of syntax is supported?
A. I havent prepared a list yet, but these tags supported:
   
   html   : a, b, i, s, u, font, br, p, indent, ol, ul, li, sub, sup, centre
   css    : please see http://www.quickzip.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=563
   bbcode : a, b, s, i, url, color, size, centre, br(same as linebreak)

   More tags will be added when my implementation is getting more stable.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Isnt this product Opensource?
A. Yes for the W32 version, because it will be troublesome to install W32 version without source.
   dotNet version will likely be turned to opensource when everything is completed.
